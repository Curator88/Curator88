- 👋 Hi, I’m @Curator88
- 👀 I’m interested in anime, games, and writing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unreal Engine 5 development and animation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games made in Unreal Engine. I have experience creating realistic 3D art but stylized non-photorealistic is my focus.
- 📫 How to reach me ... For now you can email me with info@playpinkpixel.com but I'll setup other contact methods in the coming days.
